The Sudoku solver game project in Java is a simple application that allows users to play and solve Sudoku puzzles. The project is built on Java technology and provides an interface to the users so that they can easily input and solve Sudoku puzzles.

The project aims at providing a fun and challenging way for users to improve their problem-solving skills.

The project also provides a variety of features to make the game, including:

  1.The reset button in a Sudoku game is used to clear all of the user's input and start the game over from scratch. This can be useful if the user makes a mistake       or gets stuck on a puzzle.
  2.The exit button in a Sudoku game is used to close the game window and return to the operating system. This can be useful if the user wants to quit the game or       switch to another application.
  3.The solution button in a Sudoku game is used to reveal the solution to the puzzle. This can be useful if the user is stuck on a puzzle or if they want to see how     the puzzle is solved.
  4.A check moves button in a Sudoku game is used to verify whether the user's current moves are valid. This can be useful if the user is unsure whether they have       made a mistake or if they want to check their progress.

The project uses the following libraries:

  Java SE Runtime Environment: This library provides the basic runtime environment for Java applications.
  Java Swing API: This library provides classes for creating graphical user interfaces.
